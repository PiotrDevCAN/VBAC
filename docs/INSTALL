INSTALL OVERVIEW
----------------

Make sure you have the following packages installed. The levels listed have
been tested. Later versions should work. Earlier versions may not. The
versions listed are the defaults for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 update 3 
which is where the templates were developed.

 - apache 1.x or 2.x where php is NOT configured for CGI use
 - php 4.3.2 or later (4.3.0 may work as well)
 - * php support for openldap 2.0.27 is needed for w3 IBM Intranet Password and Bluegroups support.
 - ** HTML::Table v1.5 from php pear (http://pear.php.net/) for building w3 v8 tables via w3table()

NOTE: Items marked with (*) are only required if you plan to use IBM
      Intranet Passwords (IIP) for user authentication

NOTE: Items marked with (**) are only required if you plan to use
      the w3table() functions for building w3v8 style tables. See the
      online docs below.
      
NOTE: If your setup of openssl / openldap / php is broken and you get SSL
      errors accessing ldaps://bluepages.ibm.com then you can use stunnel 
      instead. See the online docs for more info.

NOTE: You MUST have apache configured to use SSL connections if you plan to
      use IIP for user authentication. Doing IIP authentication over HTTP
      will result in an error page. This can be hacked
      around but you really don't want the same password you use to access all
      your personal HR data being sent in clear text across the IBM networks. 
      
INSTALL
-------

NOTE: The info below will change slightly if you're using the current CVS
      tree. If you know how to use CVS then most likely you can also figure
      out how to install this template given the info below :)

NOTE: See below for upgrade info if you've installed a previous version.

1) Use tar to uncompress the w3php-v8-X.XX.tgz file. 

2) Copy the contents of w3php-v8-X.XX/site/* to /var/www/http/ or wherever your 
   apache documentroot is setup. (For example, RHEL3 uses /var/www/html 
   for the default documentroot.) 

3) cp sample.htaccess to /var/www/html/.htaccess and edit the paths in it.

4) In your httpd.conf make sure "AllowOverride All" and "Options All" is set
   for the documentroot directory you installed to. If you don't do this
   then you will see apache config errors in your error_log file.
   
5) Edit the php/w3config.php and php/menuconf.php files. See the
   comments in each file for more info. You shouldn't have to edit
   the other files but you might want to wait to edit the menuconf.php
   file until you're sure the templates work correctly.

6) Fire up your web browser and point them at your site. :) If you don't
   get the results you expect check the config steps above and look in 
   /var/log/httpd/error_log for any messages about problems with your 
   config.
